<h2>What are training zones?</h2>
<p>We’ve all heard people referring to which ‘zones’ they are riding in – but what does this actually mean, where do training zones come from and how can you use them effectively?<br>

Training zones refer to the intensity at which are riding at. Riding at different intensities brings about different physiological adaptations and, therefore, the idea behind having specific training zones is you can control and measure how hard you are riding, thus giving you the ability to target specific improvements in your form.

There are different models with regards to the number of training zones – more on this later – but the basis of all training zones is what we refer to as threshold. There are actually two different thresholds: aerobic and anaerobic threshold.</p>
